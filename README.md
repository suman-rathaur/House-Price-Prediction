# House-Price-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using various features and regression techniques. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable model that can estimate the market value of a house based on its characteristics.

## Technology and tools covered:
  1. Python
  2. Model Building: Data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc
  3. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
  4. Matplotlib for data visualization
  5. Sklearn for model building
  6. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
  7. Python flask for http server
  8. Postman: to verify the availability of the localhost server and check the values
  9. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

## Finding Best model using GridSearch CV:

Since, Linear Regression gave the best score. We have used that for our models.

## Steps to run:
  1. Download folder
  2. In Visual Studio Code, run util.py, server.py
  3. Once, localhost is up, open app.html in your browser
